# Sudoku
Implementation of the sudoku problem in python's pygame library

### Motivation
This project was inspired by initially attempting to solve a sudoku puzzle while on a treadmill. This failed miserablly. So like any other programmer I coded a sudoku solver (may have also needed to learn how sudoku is solved too). Further versions of the project then included the puzzle, where cells are removed and difficulties are set for the generated puzzle.

### Build Status
Further testing on the threading aspect is needed. However, in generally the code performs well without bugs (i think).
Some variables might also be redundant. And further optimisation of several methods or functions need to be carried out.

### Credits
A portion of the Button class from https://github.com/formazione/pygame_button was used
